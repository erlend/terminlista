Terminlista
===========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/erlend/terminlista.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/erlend/terminlista)

~~Creates and hosts iCalendar files for Norwegian football teams.~~

[NFF](http://www.fotball.no/) now offers this service themself, so this app
now just redirects to the correct calendar on their site.

Getting started
---------------
You will first need to have Ruby 2.0 or higher installed, then a quick
`bundle install` should take care of the rest of the dependencies.

After all the prerequisites are installed the server can be started with
`rackup`.
